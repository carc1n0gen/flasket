You’ll find this post in your `posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `flask run`, which launches a development server that always serves the most up-to-date version of the site.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Flasket also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```py
def print_hi(name):
    print(f'Hi, {name}')

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Flasket readme](https://github.com/carc1n0gen/flasket) for more info on how to get the most out of Flasket. File all bugs/feature requests at [Flasket’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/carc1n0gen/flasket). If you have questions, you can create a github issue on the repo as well.
